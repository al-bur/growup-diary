# context-rerender

### rerender

All consumers that are descendants of a Provider will re-render whenever the Providerâ€™s value prop changes. The propagation from Provider to its descendant consumers (including .contextType and useContext) is not subject to the shouldComponentUpdate method, so the consumer is updated even when an ancestor component skips an update.
